On a cloudy weekday in Mississauga, Absolute Robotics 4308 traded gears and circuits for shovels and soil. As part of our ongoing community initiative, 15 of our dedicated team members and volunteers came together to plant 200 trees in just 3 hours. Partnering with the City of Mississauga, this event allowed us to connect our passion for STEM with environmental stewardship. Whether it's building robots or helping restore green spaces, our team is committed to making a meaningful impact both on and off the competition field. According to rough estimates, these 200 trees will offset approximately 7 metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next 10 years. That’s equivalent to around 27,500 km of car travel! We’re proud to support a greener future and thank everyone who joined us. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue combining technology, teamwork, and community spirit!
