Thank you to everyone who visited Absolute Robotics at the 2024-2025 club fair!

We were so excited to see all the new and returning faces at our booth.
We hope to see you at our information meeting this **Wednesday, September 11** and at our first official meeting on **Thursday, September 19**.
It has been an awesome start of the season and we had such a fun time meeting you all!

P.S. Goosifer and his new friend had lots of fun as well!
