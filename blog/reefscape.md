We're proud to present our 2025 robot for the Reefscape season - Doohickey!

Doohickey is a fast, offensive robot that focuses on L2, L3, and algae removal objectives.

The robot consists of an agile swerve drivetrain, a speedy cascade elevator, a fixed end effector with a full 360 degree rotation arm, and a robust funnel.

It stays ahead of the competition with advanced on-the-fly path planning auto alignment through vision processing and simultaneous coral scoring and algae removal.

We're excited to see how Doohickey performs in the 2025 season, and we hope to see you at our competitions.
